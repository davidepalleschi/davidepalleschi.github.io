I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, dedicated to advancing these technologies through innovative projects. My journey in AI is driven by a commitment to pushing boundaries and developing solutions for real-world challenges.

I hold a Masterâ€™s Degree in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, with a thesis titled ["Privacy-oriented Object Detection: Detecting People and Actions in Low-Resolution Images"](/projects/1_project/)  This project involved testing models like YOLOv8 and creating custom datasets, achieving a 400% improvement in detection accuracy for low-resolution videos.

My technical expertise includes **Python, C/C++, JavaScript**, and libraries such as **PyTorch, OpenCV, and Numpy**. I excel in detecting and addressing issues like model overfitting, ensuring robust performance in diverse scenarios.

I thrive in collaborative environments, leveraging strong communication skills to resolve challenges. Beyond professional work, I am interested in [**IoT and smart home technologies**](/projects/3_project/), creating devices and learning [**electronics, PCB design, and 3D modeling.**](/projects/2_project/)

Excited about the intersection of AI and IoT, I aspire to develop smart home systems that autonomously manage domestic environments. In my free time, I stay engaged with AI advancements and home automation, aiming to contribute to transformative projects that positively impact lives.
