Since renovating my home in 2016, I embarked on a journey into home automation, initially using SmartThings alongside basic Z-Wave devices like lights and shutters. However, after a few years, I found this setup too restrictive and transitioned to Home Assistant. Over time, I have expanded my system to include over 100 devices, utilizing protocols such as Zigbee, Z-Wave, WiFi, and Bluetooth, as well as various DIY devices for advanced automation.

In the realm of automation, I have leveraged Node-RED to create hundreds of automations. These range from simple setups with few conditions to highly complex configurations involving up to ten different conditions, effectively covering a wide array of scenarios.

Currently, the home automation areas in my setup include lighting, shutters, radiators, air conditioning, music and smart speakers, electricity and electrical load control, a vacuum cleaner, automatic front door opening, and a burglar alarm. The sensors integrated into these automations monitor temperature, humidity, air quality, CO2 levels, room occupancy, and contact points on every window and the front door.

This extensive automation network enables me to maintain a highly automated home, continuously updated with the latest IoT innovations, allowing me to experiment with new devices and technologies regularly.
