During my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, I developed an individual project for the Interactive Graphics course. This project involved creating a simple video game using the WebGL library, which required me to learn the fundamentals of 3D modeling, camera positioning, and object manipulation. I also gained skills in animating characters to ensure smooth movements and understanding the rendering process to effectively send information to the graphics card.

For this project, I tapped into my creativity and designed a game where the player navigates a character through a maze while being pursued by luminous cubes. The objective is to escape the maze, which becomes increasingly challenging with each level. The game features 10 different levels and multiple difficulty settings to keep players engaged.

You can play the game at the following link: [Maze Escape Game](https://sapienzainteractivegraphicscourse.github.io/final-project-dp-final-project/). For optimal performance, please ensure that your browser has graphics acceleration enabled.

This project not only allowed me to apply technical skills in WebGL and 3D graphics but also to experiment with game design and development, enhancing my problem-solving abilities and creativity.
